# DDoS Dectection Program

This application monitors the usage of your computer, watching for moments where
the CPU, memory, disk, or connections are higher than normal, signalling a possible DoS or DDoS attack.

# To use

To run the program, first set the parameters to fit your computer. 

Threshold of the connections to your computer
connection_threshold = x

The number of times the program runs per second
sleep_interval = x

Threshold of the CPU usage (Percentage)
cpu_threshold = x%

Threshold of the memory usage (Percentage)
memory_threshold = x%

Threshold of the disk usage (Percentage)
disk_threshold = x%

After, the program will track all of these parameters on your computer, and if any of them breach the 
threshold, you will be notified.
